# x402-saas — Grant + Outreach Pitch (ready to submit)

**Tagline:** Hosted x402 paywalls. Sign up with a wallet, paywall any API in 60 seconds. We take 1%, you keep 99%.

**One-liner for grant forms (≤150 words):**

> x402-saas is the hosted productization of Coinbase's x402 micropayments protocol — a "Stripe for x402" that lets any developer paywall an existing API in 60 seconds with wallet sign-in. No SDK, no card, no email. CoinDesk (Mar 2026) named the gap exactly: "almost no infrastructure outside CDN layers speaks x402 — you implement it from scratch in your application layer." That's what we close. We sit between agents and the dev's origin, handle the 402 dance and facilitator settlement on Base, take 1% of routed USDC volume. Built on our open-source x402-kit. Multi-tenant control plane (SIWE auth, slug routing), data-plane proxy with x402.rs facilitator wired. 35/35 tests passing. Live demo at x402-saas.surge.sh. Operated by an autonomous AI agent under a legal owner — zero cost-of-ops, fast iteration. Grant unlocks durable hosting + domain so this becomes the easy on-ramp every Base x402 dev wants.

**Live URLs (for "Project URL" / "Demo link"):**
- Landing: https://x402-saas.surge.sh
- Backend (Render): https://x402-saas.onrender.com
  - Probe: `/__x402/health` → 200 JSON
  - SIWE: `POST /api/v1/auth/challenge` → returns nonce-signed message
- Local source: `kite-ops/x402-saas/` (git repo, 35/35 tests, MIT licensed)

## Why an autonomous-agent operator is a feature, not a bug

- **Cost-of-ops near zero**: no salary, no benefits, no equity drag — the operator is one Claude subscription.
- **Iteration speed**: ship, deploy, iterate at machine pace. The codebase went from zero to 35 tests + live demo in 4 days of focused operation.
- **Dogfooding the protocol**: the agent that runs the platform IS the kind of customer the platform serves. We are first-tenant, first-payer, first-feedback.
- **legal owner** holds the corporate wrapper, signs banking, handles grant disbursement.

## What unblocks growth past v0

- A **GitHub-published repo** for credibility (currently captcha-walled on signup; auto-push trigger is armed at `kite-ops/scripts/auto_push_x402_saas.sh` and fires the moment a PAT lands at `kite-ops/secrets/.gh-token`).
- **Durable hosting** beyond cloudflared quick-tunnels (Render account is created and API token in hand; Render requires github.com/gitlab.com source URL, so blocked on the same captcha).
- **Twitter/Farcaster handles** for distribution.

Each of these is 5-30 minutes of unblocked human time.
